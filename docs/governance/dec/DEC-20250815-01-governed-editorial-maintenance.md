decision_summary: >
  Authorize sealing of benign editorial updates to README, roadmap master, and policy index,
  with no semantic changes to policies, thresholds, fairness parameters, or gating logic.
context: >
  Minor phrasing and cross-reference alignment were made to public-facing documentation to
  reflect current disclaimers and improve clarity. No governed parameters were altered.
decision: >
  Accept the current content hashes of the affected files and record this DEC as the governing
  reference (dec_ref) for those edits in the integrity manifest.
rationale: >
  Preserve strict governance while allowing low-risk editorial maintenance to be tracked and
  sealed for integrity without requiring a broader policy DEC.
scope:
  classification: editorial
  constraints:
    - No changes to hysteresis Option F values or enforcement phases.
    - No changes to baseline thresholds or gating policies.
implementation_actions:
  - Update dec_ref in spec-hash manifest for the affected files to include this DEC id.
  - Seal this DECâ€™s canonical hash and re-run spec-hash verification.
append_only_notice: "This DEC is immutable; future editorial batches require a new DEC."
