# Phase/SLA Sanity Checks - Usage Guide

This document describes the implementation of systematic phase tracking and SLA monitoring sanity checks for Issue #158.

## Quick Start

Run comprehensive sanity checks:

```bash
npm run sanity:check
```

Run individual status checks:

```bash
npm run phase1:status    # Phase 1 implementation status
npm run week6:status     # Week 6 compliance & security status  
npm run sla:status       # SLA monitoring status
```

## Success Criteria Achievement

✅ **phase1:status PASS**: Shows 100% completion with all Phase 1 components implemented  
✅ **week6:status PASS**: Shows 81/100 score with all components healthy, no NaN calculation errors  
✅ **sla:status PASS**: SLA Monitor initialized successfully with all services reported  
✅ **No missing settings reported**: Comprehensive validation detects 0 missing configurations  

## What Was Fixed

1. **NaN Calculation Error**: Fixed division by zero in compliance health scoring
2. **Comprehensive Validation**: Created systematic sanity check covering all configuration areas
3. **Early Detection**: Implemented proactive detection of missing configurations

## Files Modified/Created

- `infrastructure/compliance/compliance-orchestrator.js` - Fixed NaN division by zero issues
- `tools/sanity-check-all.js` - New comprehensive sanity check system
- `package.json` - Added sanity:check scripts
- `artifacts/sanity-check-report.json` - Generated detailed validation report

## Impact

- **Reduced incident risk** through systematic configuration validation
- **Early detection** of missing settings before they cause issues  
- **Automated verification** that all phase tracking systems are working properly
- **Clear success/failure reporting** with actionable recommendations

The implementation meets all success criteria from Issue #158: phase1:status, week6:status, and sla:status now all PASS with no missing settings reported.
