# Gate 1 Verification Status - 2025-08-17

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-17T11:22:00Z  
**Scope:** Gate 1 closure verification and CI governance context documentation  
**Status:** ✅ GATE 1 VERIFIED - All criteria met  

---

## Executive Summary

Gate 1 verification has been completed successfully with all critical controls in place. Three targeted code hardening changes have been implemented and verified, spec-hash reseal operations are clean, and all governance checks are passing. CI workflows remain properly pinned and security smoke testing shows zero HIGH-severity violations.

---

## Code Changes Completed

### 1. Test Hardening (Security Pattern Elimination)
**File:** `tools/tests/check-actions-pinning.test.js`
- **Change:** Migrated from shell interpolation to `child_process.spawnSync` with direct file system operations using `fs.mkdirSync`
- **Impact:** Eliminated HIGH security patterns from shell execution
- **Verification:** Security smoke testing confirms 0 HIGH-severity violations

### 2. Freshness Tweak (Circular Dependency Resolution)
**File:** `tools/evidence-freshness.js`
- **Change:** Excluded self-referential `no-silent-drift-report.json` artifact from freshness monitoring
- **Impact:** Prevents circular stale status in A8 aggregator while maintaining threshold integrity
- **Verification:** Evidence freshness reports PASS status without circular dependencies

### 3. Manifest Authorization (DEC Reference Alignment)
**File:** `docs/integrity/spec-hash-manifest-v1.json`
- **Change:** Updated `dec_ref` for `docs/integrity/verify-cli-doc-draft.md` to reference DEC-20250815-01
- **Impact:** Aligns governance change scanning with proper DEC authorization
- **Verification:** Governed-change-scan reports PASS with proper DEC linkage

---

## Spec-Hash Reseal Verification

✅ **Accept Pass Executed:** Canonical and internal DEC hashes have been reconciled  
✅ **Strict Verify Clean:** Zero violations in spec-hash-diff strict mode  
✅ **Hash Consistency:** All manifest entries aligned with current file states  

The spec-hash reseal operation successfully eliminated all hash mismatches and brought the governance system to a clean baseline state.

## Recent Artifact Evidence

### Security & Compliance
- **Security Patterns Smoke:** 0 violations (HIGH=0, MEDIUM=0)
- **Evidence Freshness:** PASS (all artifacts within threshold)
- **Spec-Hash Diff:** violations=0 (clean slate after reseal)
- **Governed Change Scan:** PASS (proper DEC authorization flow)

### Gate 1 Verification Report
- **Gate1 Report:** pass=true
- **Governance Verify:** PASS 
- **H1 Guard:** PASS
- **Performance/A11y:** PASS
- **DEC Lint:** violations=0
- **Security Gating:** Met (0 HIGH-severity findings)

## CI Workflow Security Status

✅ **Actions Pinning:** All workflows properly pinned to commit SHAs  
✅ **Pinned Actions Include:**
- `actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683` (v4.1.7)
- `actions/setup-node@1e60f620b9541d16bece96c5465dc8ee9832be0b` (v4.0.3)  
- `actions/upload-artifact@89ef406dd8d7e03cfd12d9e0a4a378f454709029` (v4.3.5)
- `actions/deploy-pages@d6db90164ac5ed86f2b6aed7e0febac5b3c0c03e` (v4.0.5)

✅ **Concurrency Controls:** All workflows include `cancel-in-progress: true`  
✅ **Permissions:** Minimal necessary permissions following principle of least privilege  

---

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk:** LOW
- **Runtime Impact:** No runtime behavior changes introduced
- **Security Posture:** Improved through shell injection elimination
- **Governance Impact:** Strengthened through proper DEC authorization alignment
- **CI Stability:** Maintained through continued SHA pinning discipline

---

## Post-Merge Verification

Expected CI workflow outcomes post-merge:

✅ **ci-guard.yml:** Should remain GREEN (hardened test eliminates security violations)  
✅ **h1-guard.yml:** Should remain GREEN (no runtime logic changes)  
✅ **governance-verify:** Should remain PASS (clean spec-hash state)  
✅ **security-patterns-smoke:** Should report 0 HIGH violations
