# Gate 2 Verification Status - 2025-08-17

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-17T13:13:14Z  
**Scope:** Gate 2 closure verification and expanded transparency implementation  
**Status:** ✅ GATE 2 VERIFIED - All criteria met  

---

## Executive Summary

Gate 2 verification has been completed successfully with all expanded transparency controls in place. Four core requirements have been implemented and verified: changelog excerpt public accessibility, equity anomaly detector stability with 100% annotation coverage, terminology adoption scanner with policy-as-code enforcement, and accessibility automated scanning with zero critical violations.

The changelog excerpt is now publicly accessible through GitHub Pages at `/changelog.html`, automatically generated from recent artifacts and monitored in CI. The equity anomaly detector operates with the required δ threshold of 0.03 and provides 100% internal annotation coverage for any detected anomalies. Terminology adoption scanning is fully integrated with CI policy enforcement (≥85% adoption, 0 banned terms), and trend reporting is available in both NDJSON and JSON formats. Accessibility scanning via Pa11y is integrated in CI with artifacts properly saved.

## Requirements Verification

### 1. Changelog Excerpt page live (H2-J1) ✅

**Implementation:** `tools/changelog-excerpt-generate.js` + Pages workflow integration

- **Route publicly accessible:** ✅ Available at `/changelog.html` via GitHub Pages
- **Summarizes recent changes:** ✅ Sources from artifacts (spec-hash, PII, disclaimers, fairness)
- **Presence monitored in CI:** ✅ `tools/changelog-presence-check.js` enforces route presence
- **Verification:** 4/4 checks passed in `artifacts/changelog-presence-check.json`

### 2. Equity Anomaly Detector stability (H1-B3) ✅

**Implementation:** `tools/equity-anomaly-detector.js` + `tools/equity-anomaly-annotate.js`

- **Delta threshold = 0.03:** ✅ Configured in `docs/fairness/hysteresis-config-v1.yml`
- **Cooldown/min sample size:** ✅ min_samples=5, cooldown_snapshots=3
- **Consistent anomaly events:** ✅ TWD-style confidence with dynamic thresholds
- **100% internal annotation coverage:** ✅ Automated annotation for all detected anomalies
- **Verification:** 100% coverage confirmed in `artifacts/equity-anomaly-coverage.json`

### 3. Terminology Adoption Scanner + Policy-as-Code (H1-F1, H1-C1) ✅

**Implementation:** `tools/terminology-adoption.js` + `tools/terminology-adoption-trend.js` + CI enforcement

- **adoptionPercent computed and persisted:** ✅ Saved to `artifacts/terminology-adoption.json`
- **CI warnings/denies per policy threshold:** ✅ ADOPTION_MIN=85, BANNED_MAX=0 enforced in CI
- **Trend report (ndjson/json) generable:** ✅ Both formats in `artifacts/terminology-adoption-trend.*`
- **Verification:** Current adoption: 100%, trend tracking enabled

### 4. Accessibility automated scan PASS (H1-H2) ✅

**Implementation:** `tools/a11y-smoke.js` integrated in H1 guard

- **Integrated axe/pa11y in CI:** ✅ Pa11y integration via h1-verify-guard.js
- **0 critical violations on primary routes:** ✅ 0 serious/critical issues detected
- **Artifacts saved under artifacts/a11y-*.json:** ✅ `artifacts/a11y-smoke-report.json`
- **Verification:** 1 minor issue (lang attribute), 0 critical violations

## Gate 2 Implementation Changes

### Tools Added

- `tools/terminology-adoption-trend.js` - Trend report generation (NDJSON/JSON)
- `tools/changelog-presence-check.js` - CI route presence monitoring
- `tools/equity-anomaly-annotate.js` - 100% annotation coverage enforcement
- `tools/gate2-verify.js` - Comprehensive Gate 2 verification

### CI Integration Updates

- **ci-guard.yml:** Added Gate 2 checks for terminology trends, changelog presence, anomaly annotation
- **pages.yml:** Added terminology trend data to published artifacts
- **Artifact uploads:** Extended to include all Gate 2 verification artifacts

### Package Scripts Added

- `npm run terms:trend` - Generate terminology adoption trend reports
- `npm run changelog:presence` - Verify changelog route presence
- `npm run equity:annotate` - Ensure anomaly annotation coverage
- `npm run gate:2` - Complete Gate 2 verification

---

## Compliance Evidence

### Changelog Transparency

- **Public route:** `https://xcodeprem.github.io/merajutasa.id/changelog.html`
- **Generation source:** Aggregates spec-hash changes, DEC impacts, PII findings, disclaimers status
- **CI monitoring:** Non-blocking for empty content, but route presence strictly enforced

### Equity Anomaly Control

- **Configuration:** δ=0.03, min=5 samples, cooldown=3 snapshots
- **Detection engine:** TWD-style confidence with phi/alpha/beta regions
- **Annotation system:** Automated severity assessment, suggested actions, confidence scoring
- **Coverage verification:** 100% requirement met for all detected anomalies

### Terminology Policy Enforcement

- **Real-time scanning:** 99 files scanned, 47 suggestions identified
- **Threshold enforcement:** ≥85% adoption required, 0 banned terms allowed
- **Trend tracking:** Historical adoption metrics with weekly averaging
- **Policy-as-code:** CI failure on violation, advisory suggestions provided

### Accessibility Assurance

- **Standards compliance:** WCAG2AA scanning via Pa11y
- **Route coverage:** Primary equity UI routes + methodology pages
- **Violation threshold:** Zero tolerance for critical/serious issues
- **Artifact preservation:** Full issue details saved for audit trail

## Gate 2 Closure Confirmation

**Status:** ✅ GATE 2 VERIFIED  
**Requirements met:** 4/4 (100%)  
**Verification timestamp:** 2025-08-17T13:13:14Z  
**Artifact reference:** `artifacts/gate2-verification.json`  

All Gate 2 criteria for expanded transparency have been successfully implemented and verified. The system now provides:

- Public changelog accessibility with CI-enforced presence monitoring
- Stable equity anomaly detection with comprehensive annotation coverage  
- Policy-enforced terminology adoption with trend reporting capabilities
- Automated accessibility scanning with zero critical violation tolerance

Gate 2 closure is approved and ready for progression to Gate 3 (Stage 2 Terminology).

---

## Next Steps (Gate 3 Preview)

Gate 3 will focus on Stage 2 Terminology adoption ≥70%, DEC Stage 2 vote, and disclaimers updates. Current terminology adoption baseline of 100% provides a strong foundation for Stage 2 transition requirements.
