## INTEGRATION WITH AUTO-ADD-PROJECT.YAML

The enhanced labeling system works seamlessly with the auto-add-project.yaml workflow:

### Automatic Field Mapping

**Labels â†’ Project Fields:**
- `area:*` labels â†’ Area field
- `component:*` labels â†’ Component field  
- `team:*` labels â†’ Team Assignment field
- `health:*` labels â†’ Health Score field
- `phase:*` labels â†’ Phase field
- `iteration:*` labels â†’ Iteration field

### Smart Status Detection

**PR States â†’ Status Field:**
- Draft PRs â†’ "To Do"
- Ready PRs â†’ "In Review"  
- Merged PRs â†’ "Done"
- Closed PRs â†’ "Done" or "Blocked" based on labels

### Enhanced Logging

The auto-add-project.yaml workflow provides comprehensive logging:
- Event details and processing status
- Field updates and mapping results
- IT Leader Summary section with key metrics
- Enterprise-grade error messages with troubleshooting

**Use structured naming:**
- `area:domain-name` for infrastructure domains
- `component:component-name` for specific components
- `team:role-name` for team assignments
- `health:score-range` for health tracking

### 2. Project Field Usage

**Required Fields:**
- Area, Phase, Priority, Status
- Team Assignment for all assigned work
- Health Score for implementation tracking

**Optional But Recommended:**
- Component for precise categorization
- Implementation Size for effort planning
- Iteration for agile tracking

### 3. Health Score Management

**Update Regularly:**
- Review health scores weekly
- Update based on actual progress
- Use for risk identification and resource allocation

### 4. Team Assignment Strategy

**Assign Based On:**
- Primary skill requirements
- Component expertise
- Workload balancing
- Cross-training opportunities

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**1. Too Many Labels**
- Use label filters in project views
- Create custom views for specific domains
- Archive obsolete labels regularly

**2. Field Mapping Conflicts**
- Ensure consistent label naming
- Review auto-add-project.yaml mapping logic
- Use manual field updates when needed

**3. Performance Impact**
- Monitor project loading times
- Consider archiving completed items
- Use pagination in large projects

### Getting Help

**Resources:**
