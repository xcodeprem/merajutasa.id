## üîß Detailed Setup (45 minutes)

### Part A: Infrastructure Validation (10 minutes)

#### 1. Verify Component Files
```bash
# Check all compliance component files exist
ls -la infrastructure/compliance/
ls -la infrastructure/security/enhanced/

# Verify file sizes match expectations
du -h infrastructure/compliance/*.js
du -h infrastructure/security/enhanced/*.js
```

**Expected Files and Sizes**:
- `audit-system.js` (19.9KB) - Enterprise audit system
- `compliance-automation.js` (33.2KB) - Compliance automation
- `privacy-rights-management.js` (34.9KB) - Privacy rights management  
- `compliance-orchestrator.js` (25.4KB) - Compliance orchestrator
- `security-hardening.js` (32.0KB) - Security hardening

#### 2. Test Component Loading
```bash
# Test each component individually
node -e "import('./infrastructure/compliance/audit-system.js').then(() => console.log('‚úÖ Audit System loaded'))"
node -e "import('./infrastructure/compliance/compliance-automation.js').then(() => console.log('‚úÖ Compliance Automation loaded'))"
node -e "import('./infrastructure/compliance/privacy-rights-management.js').then(() => console.log('‚úÖ Privacy Rights loaded'))"
```

### Part B: Compliance Framework Configuration (15 minutes)

#### 1. Configure Compliance Frameworks
```bash
# Setup compliance assessment configuration
mkdir -p artifacts/compliance
mkdir -p artifacts/audit
mkdir -p artifacts/privacy
mkdir -p artifacts/security

# Verify compliance frameworks configuration
npm run compliance:report
```

#### 2. Initialize Audit System
```bash
# Start audit system with enterprise configuration
npm run compliance:audit

# Verify audit logging is working
npm run audit:report

# Check audit storage
ls -la artifacts/audit/
```

**Expected Audit Features**:
- GDPR/SOX/ISO27001/PCI compliance tagging
- Immutable audit trails with cryptographic integrity
- Real-time audit event processing
- Automated retention policy enforcement

#### 3. Setup Privacy Rights Management
```bash
# Initialize privacy rights processing
npm run privacy:rights

# Test privacy request processing
npm run privacy:request

# Verify privacy compliance
npm run privacy:report
```

**Supported Privacy Jurisdictions**:
- GDPR (European Union)
- CCPA (California)
- PIPEDA (Canada)
- LGPD (Brazil)

### Part C: Security Configuration (10 minutes)

#### 1. Configure Security Hardening
```bash
# Initialize security hardening system
npm run security:hardening

# Run comprehensive security scan
npm run security:scan

# Perform threat detection analysis
npm run security:threats
```

**Note**: Security Hardening component has import dependency issues (40/100 score) but core functionality is operational.

#### 2. Setup Security Monitoring
```bash
# Verify security scanning capabilities
node -e "console.log('Security hardening file size:', require('fs').statSync('infrastructure/security/enhanced/security-hardening.js').size + ' bytes')"

# Check security configuration
grep -n "SecurityHardening" infrastructure/security/enhanced/security-hardening.js | head -5

#### 1. Configure Compliance Orchestrator
```bash
# Start compliance orchestration
npm run compliance:orchestrator

# Verify orchestration status
npm run week6:status | grep -A 10 "Component Status"
```

**Note**: Compliance Orchestrator has dependency issues (40/100 score) affecting unified coordination but basic monitoring is functional.

#### 2. Test Integration
```bash
# Run comprehensive integration tests
npm run week6:test

# Verify cross-component communication
grep -r "import.*compliance" infrastructure/compliance/ | head -5

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Security Hardening Component Failed (40/100)
**Symptoms**: Security hardening tests fail with import errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check import dependencies
grep -n "import.*audit-system" infrastructure/security/enhanced/security-hardening.js

# Verify file paths
ls -la infrastructure/security/compliance/
ls -la infrastructure/compliance/
```

**Workaround**: Core security functionality works despite import issues. Use individual security scripts:
```bash
npm run security:scan
npm run security:threats
```

#### Issue 2: Compliance Orchestrator Failed (40/100)
**Symptoms**: Orchestrator coordination fails with dependency errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check orchestrator dependencies
grep -n "import" infrastructure/compliance/compliance-orchestrator.js | head -5

# Verify component availability
npm run week6:status | grep -A 5 "Orchestrator"
```

**Workaround**: Use individual compliance components directly:
```bash
npm run compliance:audit
npm run compliance:automation
npm run privacy:rights
```

#### Issue 3: Audit Storage Permissions
**Symptoms**: Audit events not saving properly

**Solution**:
```bash
# Create audit directories with proper permissions
mkdir -p artifacts/audit
chmod 755 artifacts/audit

# Test audit storage
npm run audit:start
npm run audit:flush
ls -la artifacts/audit/
```

#### Issue 4: NPM Script Not Found
**Symptoms**: `npm run week6:*` commands not working

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify package.json scripts
grep -A 10 -B 10 "week6" package.json

# Check if scripts exist
npm run | grep week6
npm run | grep compliance
npm run | grep security
npm run | grep privacy
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Debug Component Loading
```bash
# Enable debug logging for specific components
DEBUG=compliance:* npm run compliance:automation
DEBUG=security:* npm run security:scan
DEBUG=privacy:* npm run privacy:rights
DEBUG=audit:* npm run audit:start
```

#### Check Component Dependencies
```bash
# Analyze import structure
grep -r "import.*from" infrastructure/compliance/ | head -10
grep -r "import.*from" infrastructure/security/enhanced/ | head -5

# Verify relative paths
find infrastructure -name "*.js" -exec grep -l "import.*\\.\\./.*" {} \;
```

#### Performance Debugging
```bash
# Monitor resource usage during compliance operations
npm run week6:demo &
PID=$!
top -p $PID
kill $PID
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Audit Logs**: Stored in `artifacts/audit/` with restricted permissions
- **Compliance Data**: Encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Privacy Requests**: Processed with automated anonymization
- **Security Scans**: Results stored securely in `artifacts/security/`

### Access Control
- **Audit System**: Role-based access to audit trails
- **Compliance Reports**: Restricted to compliance officers
- **Privacy Requests**: Access limited to privacy officers
- **Security Scans**: Limited to security team members

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Retention**: 7+ year retention for audit trails
- **Encryption**: All compliance data encrypted with AES-256
- **Access Logging**: All system access logged and monitored
- **Incident Response**: Automated response to compliance violations

---

## üìà Performance Optimization

### System Tuning
```bash
# Optimize audit processing
export AUDIT_BATCH_SIZE=1000
export COMPLIANCE_CACHE_SIZE=500MB

# Configure privacy processing
export PRIVACY_QUEUE_SIZE=100
export PRIVACY_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT=30000

# Setup security scanning
export SECURITY_SCAN_DEPTH=3
export THREAT_DETECTION_SENSITIVITY=medium
```

### Resource Management
```bash
# Monitor system resources
npm run week6:status | grep -A 5 "files_found"

# Check memory usage
ps aux | grep -E "(audit|compliance|privacy|security)"

# Monitor disk usage
du -sh artifacts/
```

### Batch Processing
```bash
# Process audit events in batches
npm run audit:flush

# Batch compliance assessments
npm run compliance:report

# Bulk privacy request processing
npm run privacy:report
```

---

## üìä Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Overall Score**: Target 75+ (currently 67/100)
- **Component Health**: 3/5 healthy, 2/5 functional
- **Compliance Score**: 92% automated assessment
- **Response Time**: 30-day privacy request processing
- **Audit Trail**: 100% event integrity with cryptographic verification

### Daily Monitoring
```bash
# Morning status check
npm run week6:status

# Compliance metrics
npm run compliance:report | grep -i "score"

# Security metrics  
npm run security:scan | grep -i "score"

# Privacy metrics
npm run privacy:report | grep -i "requests"
```

### Alert Configuration
