## Quick Start Commands

### Development Workflow
```bash
npm run lint                    # Lint all files
npm run test                    # Run all tests
npm run governance:verify       # Verify governance integrity
```

### Infrastructure Operations
```bash
npm run infra:start-all         # Start core infrastructure
npm run week6:validate          # Validate Week 6 components
npm run compliance:start-all    # Start compliance services
```

### Status Checks
```bash
npm run phase1:status           # Phase 1 status
npm run week6:status            # Week 6 component status  
npm run week6:health-check      # Week 6 health demo
```

### Testing
```bash
npm run test:governance         # Governance tests
npm run test:infrastructure     # Infrastructure tests
npm run week6:integration-test  # Week 6 integration tests
```

## Dependencies

Added dependencies:
- `concurrently` - For running multiple scripts simultaneously

## Script Organization Benefits

1. **Reduced Count**: 202 â†’ 200 scripts (removed obsolete, added essential)
2. **Better Grouping**: 23 logical categories instead of mixed organization
3. **Linux Compatibility**: Removed all PowerShell dependencies
4. **Week 6 Integration**: Complete integration testing for newest components
5. **Improved Discoverability**: Clear naming conventions and grouping
6. **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive validation pipelines

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding script group comments directly in package.json
2. Update CI/CD pipelines to use new script names
3. Document environment-specific requirements for Docker/K8s scripts
4. Add script aliases for common development workflows
