# Next steps: PR #85 merge and governance status (2025-08-23)

- Placeholders in enterprise issue blocks have been replaced across parents/children (and grandchildren). Artifact: artifacts/enterprise-issue-propagation-2025-08-23.json
- PR #85: Code owner approval present (xcodeprem). Merge still blocked by required checks failing.
- Required contexts expected by branch protection: ci/build, ci/lint, ci/test, security/codeql, security/secret-scan.
- Current state: underlying runs show failures in CI Guard (H1), CodeQL (Analyze javascript), Gitleaks (scan), and governance guards. The reporter cannot mark required contexts green when upstream is failing.

Action items

1) Stabilize CI Guard (H1) on branch copilot/fix-19 or re-run flaky jobs after addressing failures.
2) Fix CodeQL failure(s) on Analyze (javascript) job; push commit to branch to re-trigger runs.
3) Fix Gitleaks scan failures (or update allowlist as per policy) so security/secret-scan can pass.
4) Once the three are green, the bridge will emit/pass the five required contexts; PR will be mergeable.

Notes

- Docs-only fast pass is working but doesnâ€™t apply to this PR.
- If desired, adjust branch protection temporarily to unblock, then restore; otherwise proceed by making the checks pass.
