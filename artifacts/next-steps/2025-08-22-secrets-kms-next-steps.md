# Next steps — Secrets/KMS rotation (2025-08-22)

Context: Follow-up items after implementing the dev KMS mock, envelope encryption, runbook, and rotation evidence.

- Hook rotation evidence into broader governance summary if desired.
- Replace mock with cloud KMS in non-dev environments and add CI gating on evidence presence.

Notes: These are optional improvements. This file is generated to honor the “save Next steps as markdown” preference.
