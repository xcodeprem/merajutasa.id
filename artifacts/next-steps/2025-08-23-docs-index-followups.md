# Next steps: docs index follow-ups (2025-08-23)

- Consider a terminology/style alignment scan across docs using tools/terminology-adoption.js; emit artifacts/terminology-adoption.json.
- Expand link-check coverage beyond docs/index.md using `npm run docs:link-check` and publish docs/_reports/link-check.json.
- Add brief “How to propose a DEC” section in governance/index.md linking to dec:new script and DEC style guide.
- Optional: add a short README pointer in docs/privacy/ to privacy rights automation scripts.

Provenance: created by automation after index refresh; deterministic and append-only.
