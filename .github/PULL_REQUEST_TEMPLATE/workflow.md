## Governance Compliance Checklist

### Actions Pinning ‚úÖ
- [ ] All GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHA (not tags or branches)
- [ ] All action SHAs are present in `.github/actions-allowlist.json`
- [ ] No new actions introduced without proper justification
- [ ] Local actions (starting with `./`) are allowed without SHA pinning

### Workflow Security üîí
- [ ] Workflow has appropriate `permissions` block (principle of least privilege)
- [ ] No secrets exposed in logs or outputs
- [ ] Input validation is present where needed
- [ ] Third-party actions are from trusted sources only

### Concurrency Configuration ‚ö°
- [ ] Workflow includes `concurrency` block with meaningful group name
- [ ] `cancel-in-progress: true` is set (unless job needs to complete)
- [ ] Concurrency group is scoped appropriately (per branch/PR)

### A8 Governance Integration üõ°Ô∏è
- [ ] Workflow includes `run-a8` composite action (if appropriate)
- [ ] `policy-path: tools/policy/policy.json` is explicitly specified
- [ ] Governance checks run before main workflow logic
- [ ] Artifacts are uploaded for audit trail

### Testing & Validation üß™
- [ ] Workflow tested in fork/draft PR
- [ ] Actions pinning linter passes: `./.github/scripts/check-actions-pinning.sh`
- [ ] No workflow syntax errors (GitHub Actions tab shows no issues)
- [ ] Dry-run tested where possible

## Action Allowlist Updates

**If adding new actions to allowlist:**

| Action | SHA | Justification | Security Review |
|--------|-----|---------------|-----------------|

- [ ] Action source code reviewed for security concerns
- [ ] Action has good security track record (no recent CVEs)
- [ ] Action follows security best practices (minimal permissions, etc.)
- [ ] SHA corresponds to a tagged release (not random commit)
